# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the app

    ```bash
     npx expo start
    ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

-   [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
-   [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
-   [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
-   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## **Architecture**

The system is divided into several major components:

-   **Mobile App (React Native)**: User interface for voice interaction, reminders, and notifications.
-   **Backend (Node.js)**: Manages API requests, connects with the database, and handles business logic.
-   **Database (MongoDB)**: Stores user data such as profiles, reminders, health reports, and interaction history.
-   **AI/ML Module (Python)**: Handles voice interaction processing, emotion detection, and speech-to-text conversions.
-   **Notification Service**: Sends push notifications and alerts for reminders and health updates (via Firebase).
